Hello World!

My name is Greg Lowery. I have been a Full-stack .Net Developer since 2007. I have worked with .Net since Framework 2.0 and am an advanced C# programmer. I have extensive experience in distributed applications having worked with Asp.Net WebForms, traditional Web Services, Asp.Net Mvc, Web Api, and now Core. Enterprise Architecture is a primary focus of mine of which I place a heavy emphasis. I consider myself a student of Dino Esposito having followed him for quite some time. I am also a PC technician having built PCs and Networks, and along with being a Microsoft certified developer, have certifications in both. I started my journey in the PC world over 20 years ago when there was less of a seperation between being a technician and a programmer. It was uncustomary to be able to build a PC you couldn't program and vice versa. As a programmer, being able to troubleshoot your PC on a low level just came with the territory. Times have changed fast.
